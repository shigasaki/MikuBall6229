# MikuBall6229
A public repository for the MikuBall bot. The intention is to test out things with a Discord bot application.

MikuBall is just a bot that responds with one of the randomly generated responses (specifically 8ball responses) in the list. MikuBall can send 8ball responses in English, Chinese, and Japanese. 

The bot can be added by anyone as it is set to public. 

Please excuse my noobness in case any is detected.
